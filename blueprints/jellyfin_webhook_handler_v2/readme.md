## 💡 Project Overview

This blueprint integrates your Jellyfin server with Home Assistant using webhooks. When significant events occur in Jellyfin (e.g., media playback, library changes, user actions), Jellyfin sends a data packet (a webhook) to your Home Assistant instance. This blueprint then captures that webhook, extracts relevant information, and triggers a Home Assistant event. Your custom automations can then respond to these events, allowing for powerful home automation based on your Jellyfin activity.

---

## ✨ Features

* Trigger automations based on various Jellyfin playback events (play, pause, stop, progress).
* Monitor server activities like item added/deleted and user actions.
* Supports multiple Jellyfin clients/rooms.
* Provides detailed webhook data for advanced automation logic.

---

## 🛒 Prerequisites

To use this blueprint, you'll need:

* **Jellyfin Server:** A running Jellyfin Media Server instance.
* **Jellyfin Webhook Plugin:** Installed on your Jellyfin server.
* **Home Assistant:** A working Home Assistant instance, accessible from your Jellyfin server.

## ⚙ How It Works

This blueprint integrates your Jellyfin server with Home Assistant using webhooks. When significant events occur in Jellyfin (e.g., media playback, library changes, user actions), Jellyfin sends a data packet (a webhook) to your Home Assistant instance. This blueprint then captures that webhook, extracts relevant information, and triggers a Home Assistant event. Your custom automations can then respond to these events, allowing for powerful home automation based on your Jellyfin activity.

## 🛠 Setup

Follow these steps to configure the Jellyfin Webhook and Home Assistant Blueprint:

### 1. Install the Jellyfin Webhook Plugin

If you haven't already, install the Webhook plugin on your Jellyfin server:

1.  **Import Jellyfin Webhook plugin:** Use the official plugin repository for Jellyfin:
    `https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-plugin-webhook`
2.  Follow the instructions to install the plugin via your Jellyfin Dashboard.

### 2. Generate a Unique Webhook ID

Generate a **unique and random string** to use as your **Webhook ID**. This ID acts as a secret key for your webhook. A [GUID generator](https://guidgenerator.com/) is a reliable tool for this purpose.

### 3. Configure the Webhook within Jellyfin

Now, configure the Webhook plugin in your Jellyfin Dashboard to send events to Home Assistant:

1.  In your Jellyfin Dashboard, navigate to **My Plugins** > **Webhook**.
2.  Click the **+** button to add a new webhook.
3.  Configure the following settings:
    * **Server Url:** `http://{server_url}:{port}` (This refers to your Jellyfin server's base URL and port, typically for local access, though the plugin handles the actual webhook URL separately)
    * **Webhook Name:** `Home Assistant` (or any descriptive name you prefer)
    * **Webhook Url:** `http://{ha_ip}:{ha_port}/api/webhook/{your_webhook_id}`
        * Replace `{ha_ip}` with your Home Assistant's IP address (or hostname).
        * Replace `{ha_port}` with your Home Assistant's port (default is `8123`).
        * Replace `{your_webhook_id}` with the unique ID you generated in step 2.
        * **Example:** `http://10.0.1.19:8123/api/webhook/-KeGmJuhypjHC7HL-fQUNyszy`
4.  Under **Notification Type**, select the events you wish to receive. It is recommended to select all the following:
    * `[x] Authentication Failure`
    * `[x] Authentication Success`
    * `[x] Item Added`
    * `[x] Item Deleted`
    * `[x] Playback Progress`
    * `[x] Playback Start`
    * `[x] Playback Stop`
    * `[x] User Created`
    * `[x] User Deleted`
    * `[x] User Locked Out`
    * `[x] User Password Changed`
    * `[x] User Updated`
5.  Under **Item Type**, select the media types you wish to monitor:
    * `[x] Movies`
    * `[x] Episodes`
    * `[x] Season`
    * `[x] Series`
    * `[x] Albums`
    * `[x] Songs`
    * `[x] Videos`
    * `[x] Trim leading and trailing whitespace from message body before sending` (Recommended)
6.  For the **Template**, you **must** use the provided Handlebars template for this blueprint to function correctly.
    * Copy the contents from: `https://github.com/thenextbutton/home_assistant/blob/main/blueprints/jellyfin_webhook_handler_v2/webhook_template.handlebars`
    * Paste the entire content into the "Template" field within the Jellyfin Webhook plugin settings.
7.  Under **Add Requester Header**, configure the following:
    * **Key:** `Content-Type`
    * **Value:** `application/json`
8.  Ensure **`[x] Enabled`** is checked under **Status**.
9.  Save your Webhook configuration in Jellyfin.

### 4. Create a Home Assistant Toggle Helper

This blueprint requires a boolean (toggle) helper to manage the state of the media playback for each client. You will need a separate helper for each Jellyfin client/room you wish to monitor.

1.  In Home Assistant, go to **Settings** > **Devices & services** > **Helpers**.
2.  Click **+ Create Helper**.
3.  Select **Toggle**.
4.  Give it a memorable name, such as `jellyfin_living_room_toggle` or `jellyfin_bedroom_player`.

### 5. Import the Blueprint into Home Assistant

If you haven't already, import the **Jellyfin Webhook Handler v2** blueprint into your Home Assistant instance using the "Release" badge at the top of this README, or by manually importing the blueprint's YAML file.

### 6. Create Your Automation

1.  In Home Assistant, go to **Settings** > **Automations & Scenes**.
2.  Click the **+ Create Automation** button and choose **Start with an empty automation**.
3.  Select the **Jellyfin Webhook Handler v2** blueprint from the blueprint dropdown.
4.  You will be prompted to enter:
    * Your generated **Webhook ID**.
    * Select the **Toggle Helper** you created in step 4.
    * Enter the **Jellyfin Client ID/Name** for the device you want to monitor.

    ---

    #### Determine Jellyfin Client ID/Name

    If you're unsure of the exact **Jellyfin Client ID** or **Client Name** for your device:

    1.  Leave the "Jellyfin Client ID/Name" field empty for now.
    2.  Enable the **'Jellyfin Client Name/ID?'** option within the blueprint's configuration.
    3.  Save the automation.
    4.  As long as you've set up the webhook correctly in Jellyfin, now **play any media on Jellyfin** using the client you wish to identify.
    5.  Within Home Assistant, you will receive a persistent notification (like the example below) displaying the client's exact name and ID.

    <img width="68" height="184" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2bf18684-f1a7-4e8b-a165-c2c2a76254b5" /><br>
    <img width="492" height="325" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/196e8810-09f3-4cb2-8d9c-5faa9ff54cd8" />


    6.  Copy either the **Client ID** or the **Client Name** and enter it into the blueprint’s **Jellyfin Client ID / Name** field.

    **Note:** The **Client ID is preferred** over the client name, as it provides a unique identifier for your device, preventing potential conflicts if you have multiple devices with the same or similar names on your network. If you enter both an ID and a Name, the ID will take preference.

### 7. Configure Automation Actions

Define the **actions** you want your Home Assistant automation to perform when the blueprint triggers. The blueprint will expose various Jellyfin events (e.g., `media_play`, `media_pause`, `media_stop`, `media_progress`, `item_added`, `user_login`) that you can use to design your automation logic.

### 8. Configuring Time Constraints
The blueprint includes a "Time Constraints" section for Movies, TV Shows, and Music. The logic follows this priority:
1. **Enable Time Constraints:** This must be **ON** for any filters to apply. If **OFF**, actions run 24/7.
2. **Sunset/Sunrise:** If enabled, actions only run when the sun is **Below Horizon**. This overrides schedules and manual times.
3. **Schedule Helper:** If a Home Assistant Schedule entity is selected, it overrides Manual Times.
4. **Manual Time Fallback:** If Sunset is OFF and no Schedule is selected, the Start/End times defined in the blueprint are used.

## 📊 Accessing Blueprint Data / Payload Structure

Within your Home Assistant automations, you can access detailed information from the Jellyfin webhook payload using Jinja2 templating. The primary data is available under `payload`.

The Handlebars template ensures a consistent `payload` structure that maps to common event types. You can inspect the notification from the "Determine Jellyfin Client ID/Name" step to see the full `payload` structure for a playback event.

**Common `payload` attributes:**

* `payload.notification_type`: The type of event (e.g., `PlaybackStart`, `PlaybackStop`, `ItemAdded`).
* `payload.item_name`: Name of the media item (e.g., movie title, song title).
* `payload.item_type`: More specific item type (e.g., `Movie`, `Episode`, `Song`).
* `payload.overview`: Synopsis/overview of a movie/tv item.
* `payload.runtime_ticks`: Total runtime of the item in ticks.
* `payload.playback_position_ticks`: Current playback position in ticks (for `PlaybackProgress` events).
* `payload.server_name`: Name of the Jellyfin server.
* `payload.user_name`: Name of the user performing the action.
* `payload.client_name`: Name of the client device (e.g., `Web`, `Android`).
* `payload.device_id`: Unique ID of the client device.

**Example(s):**

* **Accessing the media item name:**
    ```yaml
    {{ payload.item_name }}
    ```

* **Getting the client name and event type:**
    ```yaml
    Jellyfin {{ payload.client_name }} triggered {{ payload.event_type }}
    ```
    ```
    *Remember to replace `YOUR_JELLYFIN_IP:8096` with your actual Jellyfin server's IP and port.*

## 🚧 Troubleshooting & Tips

* **Webhook Not Triggering:**
    * **Check Plugin Installation:** Ensure the Webhook plugin is correctly installed and enabled in Jellyfin.
    * **Verify Webhook URL:** Double-check your Jellyfin webhook URL for any typos, especially the IP address, port (`8123`), and the unique Webhook ID.
    * **Network Access:** Ensure your Home Assistant instance is accessible from your Jellyfin server (e.g., no firewall blocking port `8123` or routing issues).
    * **Jellyfin Logs:** Check your Jellyfin server logs for any errors related to webhooks.
    * **Selected Notification/Item Types:** Ensure the specific "Notification Type" and "Item Type" checkboxes are selected in the Jellyfin webhook configuration for the events you expect to receive.
    * **Handlebars Template:** Verify that the correct `webhook_template.handlebars` content has been pasted entirely and correctly into the Jellyfin webhook template field.
* **Home Assistant Logs:** If you're not seeing the expected behavior, review your Home Assistant logs (Settings > System > Logs) for any errors related to `webhook` or this blueprint.
* **Multiple Clients:** The blueprint supports handling events from multiple Jellyfin clients. You will need to create a separate Home Assistant automation (and a separate toggle helper) for each distinct client/room you wish to monitor.
