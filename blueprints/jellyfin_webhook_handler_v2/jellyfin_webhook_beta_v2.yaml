  homeassistant:
    min_version: "2024.6.0"
  description: |
    Automate Home Assistant actions using Jellyfin webhooks.
    A Client Name or ID is required for playback and media event actions.

    **Important:** This blueprint requires a specific webhook template to be configured in Jellyfin.
    - Full setup instructions: https://github.com/thenextbutton/home_assistant/blob/main/blueprints/jellyfin_webhook_handler_v2/readme.md
    - Required webhook template design: https://github.com/thenextbutton/home_assistant/blob/main/blueprints/jellyfin_webhook_handler_v2/webhook_template.handlebars

    For general webhook setup, see:
    - Home Assistant webhook trigger: https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/trigger#webhook-trigger
    - Jellyfin Webhook Plugin: https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-plugin-webhook

    Progress Process calculates the following usable variables within the progress actions:
    - '{{ media_playback_time }}' : 00:00:32 (format hh:mm:ss)
    - '{{ media_remaining_time }}' : 00:05:31 (format hh:mm:ss)
    - '{{ media_total_time }}': 00:06:03 (format hh:mm:ss)
    - '{{ media_played_percentange }}': 008.8% (format 000.0%)
    - '{{ media_left_precentage }}': 091.2% (format 000.0%)
