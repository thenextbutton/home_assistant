### [Plex Webhooks](https://github.com/thenextbutton/home_assistant/tree/main/blueprints/plex_webhook_handler)

Blueprint for Home Assistant to allow automation actions when webhooks are sent from [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/). Great for lowering the lights when a movie starts to play, pausing specific automations during playback, and more.


### [Jellyfin Webhooks](https://github.com/thenextbutton/home_assistant/tree/main/blueprints/jellyfin_webhook_handler_v2)

Blueprint for Home Assistant to allow automation actions when webhooks are configured for [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/). Great for lowering the lights when a movie starts to play, updating a media sensor, and other automations based on playback events.


**Important Note:** Don't forget that the webhook template is also needed to be set up within Jellyfin using this template handlebar code: [webhook_template.handlebars](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thenextbutton/home_assistant/main/blueprints/jellyfin_webhook_handler_v2/webhook_template.handlebars)


### [Frigate Camera Offline](https://github.com/thenextbutton/home_assistant/tree/main/blueprints/camera_offline)

Blueprint for Home Assistant to notify a device if a camera goes offline within [Frigate](https://frigate.video/).
